# ITP Weather Band

## Who We Are

ITP Weather Band is an experimental band creating music with weather data collected from a DIY weather station. We built a DIY weather station system and created experimental instruments that turn the environmental data into music and visuals. We use sound and music as mediums for delivering information about our immediate environment through the auditory and visual sense. 

The band consists of faculties, alums, and graduate students at New York Universityâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU ITP). If you are interested in hosting our performances, using our weather data, or collaborating with us, please email us at itpweatherband@gmail.com.
