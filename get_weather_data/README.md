# Weather Band Get-Data Examples

The codes here are example p5.js and Arduino sketches that get weather data from our database. You can see the tutorial workshop recordings [here](https://github.com/ITPNYU/Weather-Band/blob/main/README.md).

You can use these examples to jump start your weather project. We'd love to see your cool creative projects that use our weather data! If you make anything, please add a credit to the ITP Wether Band and [let us know](mailto:ys2643@nyu.edu) so we can add your work to our weather gallery (coming soon) ðŸŒž

If you want to see our instruments that use the data, feel free to check out our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3Dx3kf--1eICcKGkuHcYw/featured). 

## Notes
### p5.js GET examples on the web editor
Adding p5.js web editor versions here for your convenience. These sketches get the weather data from our database and plot a graph that shows the trend of each data.
