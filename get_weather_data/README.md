# Weather Band Get-Data Examples

The codes here are example p5.js and Arduino sketches that get weather data from our database.  

You can use these examples to jump start your weather project. We'd love to see your cool creative projects that use our weather data! If you make anything, please add a credit to the ITP Wether Band and [let us know](mailto:ys2643@nyu.edu) so we can add your work to our weather gallery (coming soon) ðŸŒž

If you want to see our instruments that use the data, feel free to check out our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3Dx3kf--1eICcKGkuHcYw/featured).

## Notes
### p5.js GET examples on the web editor
Adding p5.js web editor versions here for your convenience. These sketches get the weather data from our database and plot a graph that shows the trend of each data.
